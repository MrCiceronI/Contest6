Description of solution M
===========

Reading user data.

Adding data to the tree.

We go around the tree and consider the maximum height of its branches.
If the heights differ by more than 1, then the tree is not balanced. 
We compare the right and left branches in this way with respect to each vertex.

Get the maximum height.
