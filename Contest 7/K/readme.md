Description of solution K
===========

Reading user data.
If we receive ltrcfnt as input, then we assign 0 to the array under the line number. 
If we assign the number of the line to be changed. 
Then, when bypassing the array, we assign forbidden laws to -1.

We derive the number of working laws and their numbers.
